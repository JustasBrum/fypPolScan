# Political Alignment/Trend of Countries Web Application
## Basic Intro
### The idea is by using sites like Wikipedia/Politico etc. to determine the political positions of a country. For example, by analysing the word usage and descriptions of countries, try to describe the econmic positions of a country. Is it a welfare state and more leanient towards left-wing economics? Or is it more an economy that is determined on the free-market and self-participation with right-wing economics? The tool will also try to plot the alignment of three different axis.
- Economic Axis (Left Wing <-> Right Wing)
- Civic Axis (Authoritarian <-> Libertarian)
- Social Axis (Progressive <-> Traditional)

### The tool will also try to deduce the trend by analysing recent political news regarding to a country.
